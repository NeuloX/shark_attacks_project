# Final Project

## Team members:
- Nelson Paulo Balino

## Project Proposal
Using Shark Attack data as the base dataset, we want to determine if there are any correlations that can be drawn from shark attacks that have occurred in the past. Correlations that we are interested in looking into include:
- What shark species are the usual suspects
- What country have the most case and fatalities
- Identify the shark species base on uploaded photo via image link

## Data Sources:
- Main dataset of shark attacks: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm.
- Scraping PDF summaries of each attack from: http://sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/pdf_directory/.
- Shark Facts from National Geo and Wikipedia

## Visualisation of Data:
- Tableau
- Using Tensorflow to identify shark species
