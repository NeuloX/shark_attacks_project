# Final Project

## Team members:
- Nelson Paulo Balino

## Project Proposal
Using Shark Attack data as the base dataset, we want to determine if there are any correlations that can be drawn from shark attacks that have occurred in the past. Correlations that we are interested in looking into include:
- What shark species are the usual suspects
- What country have the most case and fatalities
- Identify the shark species base on uploaded photo via image link

## Data Sources:
- Main dataset of shark attacks: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm.
- Scraping PDF summaries of each attack from: http://sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/pdf_directory/.

## Visualisation of Data:
- Choropleth map of where most attacks occur, toggling on and off which attacks are fatal (https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/)
- Sunburst chart of attacks and breaking down the region and shark breed (https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-sunburst)
- Map to show tidal patterns potentially.
